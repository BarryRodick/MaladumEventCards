            <h2>About Deck Builder</h2>
            <p>
                Deckbuilder has been designed specifically for <strong>Maladum</strong>. I found configuring the event deck to be a little clunky, and for a single-player game, the additional setup time was something I wanted to avoid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Deckbuilder removes the need for you to set up and configure the event deck, select your cards, set the scenario rules, and voilaâ€”you are good to go!
            </p>
            <p>
                Maladum is a great game, and I am glad to be able to offer something back to the community.

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            <h4>1. How do I select the games for my deck?</h4>
            <p>Click on the "Select Games" button in the header to choose which game expansions you want to include. Selecting a game will load all its associated cards into the deck builder.</p>
            
            <h4>2. How do I select card types?</h4>
            <p>After selecting your desired games, use the "Select Card Types" button to specify which types of cards you want in your deck. You can adjust the number of each card type using the provided controls.</p>
            
            <h4>3. What are Difficulty Levels?</h4>
            <p>Difficulty Levels allow you to adjust the complexity of your deck by setting the number of Novice and Veteran cards. Higher difficulty settings increase the number of Veteran cards, making the deck more challenging.</p>
            
            <h4>4. What are Sentry and Corrupter Rules?</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Sentry Rules:</strong> When enabled, Sentry cards such as Revenant and Malagaunt are added to your deck when you apply the correct 'Card Action'.
                <br>
                <strong>Corrupter Rules:</strong> Enabling Corrupter rules replaces a specified number of random cards in your deck with Corrupter cards, adding unpredictability and complexity to your gameplay.
            </p>
            
            <h4>5. How does deck generation work?</h4>
            <p>Once you've selected your games, card types, and configured any special rules, click the "Generate Deck" button. The application will compile your selections into a customized deck, applying any rules you've set. You can then navigate through your deck using the provided controls.</p>
            
            <h4>6. How can I manage cards that are in play?</h4>
            <p>As you navigate through your deck, you can mark cards as "In Play" by clicking the respective button. This allows you to keep track of active cards and manage them effectively within your gameplay.</p>
            
            <h4>7. Will my configurations be saved?</h4>
            <p>Yes! Your deck configurations are automatically saved in your browser's local storage. This means you can close the application and return later to find your settings intact.</p>
            
            <h4>8. What happens when there's an update to the application?</h4>
            <p>If a new version of the application is available, you'll receive a notification prompting you to reload the page. This ensures you always have access to the latest features and improvements.</p>
